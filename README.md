# Data Science School

This repo contains all the individual([Anomaly-Detection](https://github.com/HROlive/LIP-Data-Science-School/tree/master/Anomaly-Detection)) and team projects([Challenge](https://github.com/HROlive/LIP-Data-Science-School/tree/master/Challenge)) that I developed during a school on [Data Science in (Astro)Particle Physics and Cosmology](https://www.lip.pt/data-science-2019/?p=index), that I attended with a grant from LIP, University of Minho, IDPASC and the COST action g2net. This event was composed of a school with courses on data science currently used in HEP (High Energy Physics) and astroparticle physics and a symposium where different companies present their current trends, needs and daily work related to Data Science.
