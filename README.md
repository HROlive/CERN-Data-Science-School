# Data Science School

This repo contains all the individual(Anomaly-Detection [a link](https://github.com/HROlive/LIP-Data-Science-School/tree/master/Anomaly-Detection) ) and team projects(Challenge) that I developed during a one-week "bootcamp" that I attended with a grant from LIP(Laboratory of Instrumentation and Experimental Particle Physics). This event was composed of a school with courses on data science currently used in HEP (High Energy Physics) and astroparticle physics and a symposium where different companies present their current trends, needs and daily work related to Data Science.
